# Technical Propostal - Gin Framework
## What
 Gin is a full-featured http framework for Go   
 [github.com/gin-gonic/gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
#### Gin main features: 
- Fast
- Middleware support
- Crash-free
- JSON validation
- Error Management

## Why

All features of this project can be done using Go std library, 
but if we use Gin, it will improve productity and make the code simpler.
Also Gin is used across other TAG projects.

- Router: Gin has fast routing with small memory footprint.
- Middleware: We can easily create middleware and chain them into our requests.
- JSON validation: We can marshal and validate JSON into our structs and vice-versa
- Crash-free: Gin can catch a panic during HTTP requests and recover it.

## Who

This framework will benefit all SDE's in the future when new requirements for the project comes up.
It will be more efficient to maintain and create new endpoints, middlewares, etc.
